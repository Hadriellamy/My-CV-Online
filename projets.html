    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Project In  C# : Bus management System</h3>
    <p>During my second year of computer engineering at university, I embarked on a challenging project to fulfill my first-semester requirements. The project involved developing a comprehensive bus management application in C# for a leading transportation company.</p>
    <p>The main goal was to gain an in-depth understanding of three critical layers in software architecture: the Data Layer (DL), Business Layer (BL), and Presentation Layer (PL), while deliberately excluding Backend (BE) technologies. By concentrating on these layers individually, I aimed to refine my skills in creating well-structured and scalable software solutions.</p>
    <p>To facilitate seamless communication between different components of the application, I utilized Factory classes to manage object transitions. This approach ensured a robust and efficient data flow within the system, improving code organization and maintainability.
       For data storage and retrieval, I employed XML and XAML. Data was sourced from XML files, and any necessary modifications to link it with the DataSource were made in the configuration file located in the "bin" directory.</p>
    <p>To enhance security, the application was protected by a password stored in the DataSource class. This measure ensured ease of access for authorized users while providing a layer of protection against unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
      A standout feature of the project was the implementation of a user-friendly interface. I designed the entire graphical interface using UserControl, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience as users navigated through various application windows. This focus on the user interface was intended to improve overall usability and efficiency.</p>

    <h3>Project in Java : Geometries in 3D</h3>
    <p>During my second year of studies, I developed a Java project titled "Geometries Form in 3D using Light Reflection and Refraction". The project aimed to create 3D representations of geometries utilizing advanced light reflection and refraction techniques. To enhance image quality, I implemented anti-aliasing methods such as super sampling and adaptive sampling, which optimized rendering and produced a more realistic visual effect.</p>
    <p>The project also incorporated development principles such as RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) to ensure efficient code management and easier maintenance. Unit tests were conducted using JUnit 4 to ensure the robustness and reliability of the system.</p>
